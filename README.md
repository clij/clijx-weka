# CLIJx-Weka
This repository contains experimental filters based on [CLIJ](https://clij.github.io) and
[Fijis](https://fiji.sc) [Trainable Weka Segmentation](https://github.com/fiji/Trainable_Segmentation). 

Goal is to enable broader applicability of [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) based and GPU-accelerated machine learning in Fiji, for example for object classification:
